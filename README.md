EmailFinder
-----------

The EmailFinder applet (http://www.creativesolid.in/resume/emailfinder), given a list of websites, searches them for emails containing terms like 'job', 'hr'.  This was written in the early days of the World Wide Web, before the wide advent of even CSS, and the 'robots.txt' standard.  So, it does not work well on modern sites.

This repository contains the source code.  Command line tools (javac, jar) were used to build and package the source.
